caption = "This Christmas reminded me of being a kid, with a little tree and a few very nice gifts under it. Luna got a couple of toys and some treats. I got a nice task jacket and some snacks. After opening the gifts, we had panes de dulce from Forma Bakery and I went to Christmas mass.<br><br>Later in the day, we had leftover lasagna, then walked around Crissy Field in between breaks from the rain. Evening brought more leftover lasagna, which we enjoyed while watching *Wake Up Dead Man*. A wonderful Christmas."
