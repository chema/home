> *Published in The San Franciscan, 1884.*

I'm sick of the bustle and strife,<br>
  And the men and the women I meet—<br>
This moving, breathing chaos of life<br>
  That surges along the street.<br>
Silent and jealous and proud—<br>
  However much I may seek,<br>
There's not a person in all the crowd<br>
  To whom I may dare to speak.<br><!--more-->
No hand is extended to greet me,<br>
  No welcome wherever I come;<br>
They're silent and haughty who meet me—<br>
  For people and houses are dumb.<br>
 <br>
O I could shout to the hills,<br>
  And they'd echo and answer again,<br>
And the loud huzza of a hundred rills<br>
  Would greet me from valley and glen.<br>
The forests so stately and grand<br>
  Would play on their harps as of old,<br>
Till an infinite melody rolled<br>
  And widened through all the land.<br>
Even now to my listening heart<br>
  Their far-off murmurings come;<br>
O when shall I leave the tumultuous mart<br>
  —Where people and houses are dumb?<br>
