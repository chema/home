In September 1960, presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon stepped into a Chicago TV studio and transformed U.S. electoral politics. For the people listening to this particular presidential debate on the radio, Nixon held his own. But for most of the 70 million who watched it on television, the photogenic Kennedy came out on top.

A new technology fundamentally changed how candidates were literally seen by voters. Makeup, presentation and clips of sound bites became electoral tactics that could not be ignored. It was a seismic political shift.

The internet has done the same. And there's no denying that this technological "stage" is largely built by people living in and around San Francisco. Their values, biases, and, yes, politics, have helped shape the multitude of systems, from the source code up.

And therein lies the rub: San Francisco's politics is idiosyncratic. It can be combative and loves technocratic solutions. The candidates and campaigns who can best navigate these systems thrive. Those who can't, don't. And these systems are exporting it globally.

## How One City's Broken Politics Became Everyone's Problem

I've been doing political work in San Francisco for fifteen years. I've spoken with thousands of San Franciscans about scores of candidates, propositions and issues over the phone and in person. I've sat through endless hearings and attended many, many community meetings. Over many electoral cycles, I've watched the political ebb and flow of this city. 

Before moving to San Francisco, in the 1990s and early 2000s, I saw the rise of open-source software and how it led to the rise and fall of [open publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_publishing) and local [independent media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indymedia) collectives, in Europe and in the U.S. Then I saw how many of these same tools and concepts were leveraged to build tech empires. I've seen a generation of people (mostly men) go from being young, ambitious, idealist libertarians, to become middle-aged, reactionary, neoliberal millionaires and centi-millionaires.

Here's what I've figured out: San Francisco exports assumptions about how politics *should* work through the digital tools that billions of people use to organize, argue, and make decisions. With the advent of AI, these assumptions are increasingly being embedded directly into the infrastructure of government itself. Indirectly, these platforms have reshaped the *operational level of politics*.

## How Politics Functions Now

Elections are won in part by asking certain questions: Who are your voters? How do you identify and contact them? How are communities prioritized, segmented and selected? How is tension and conflict between communities considered?

San Francisco's answer to these questions got shaped by our geography and our history. We also have a wealthy base of investors and well-connected political class that had experience wrangling massive public and private investments. The result is a well-funded political faction that has increasingly treated every political problem like a design challenge. Housing crisis? We need to optimize zoning. Democracy too messy? Build an app. Community conflict? Adopt large language models (LLMs) for mediating citizen input and even drafting policy.

The core assumption appears to be increasingly the same: tension can be avoided through technical solutions. And this prevailing ethos gets baked into the tools that nearly everyone uses to do politics.

## How It Spreads

Most tech workers don't arrive here with deep political experience. They come here young, ready to build things and make money. That means that often San Francisco shapes their political culture. They sit through community meetings where neighbors argue about bike lanes for hours. They watch the Board of Supervisors fight over whether to build 50 units or 100 units while thousands of people sleep outside. They see a city that talks endlessly about progress while getting bogged down in Byzantine issues.

So they start conceptualizing tools to fix what they see as inefficiencies in how decisions are made. Make democracy more user-friendly. Let data drive decisions. Cut through the noise.

Furthermore, this influence isn't limited to the tools themselves. We're now seeing a trend where individuals involved in local San Francisco politics, who have campaigned on platforms to 'fix' the city's inefficiencies, are transitioning directly into leadership roles within prominent tech companies in San Francisco. They are taking their specific understanding of 'broken' government and their belief in technical solutions, and applying it directly to the development of things like 'AI' for state and local government operations. This creates a direct pipeline for embedding a singular city's political culture into the very operating system of civic life, making these tools global.

## The Examples Are Everywhere

Look at Reddit, based in SF since 2006. The entire platform is built around the idea that the best content rises to the top through voting, like some kind of perfect meritocracy. Very San Francisco. The assumption that technical systems can replace messy human judgment about what matters. At the same time, unelected and largely unaccountable community moderators replicate the [Benevolent Dictator for Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) leadership model that dominates the open source community, shaping the rules, biases and social queues in their subreddits, in a digital ["founder takes all"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_takes_all) effect. 

Similarly, Twitter started as a way to democratize information, built by people who genuinely believed that more speech automatically leads to better outcomes. Very San Francisco. And very exploitable by anyone who understood that engagement doesn't equal enlightenment and that controversy drives engagement, as [Trump demonstrated as early as 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/donald-trump-social-media-strategy-internet-republican-nomination-president) when he turned provocative tweets into free mainstream TV coverage worth millions and eventually [88.9 million followers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_use_by_Donald_Trump).

Beyond these foundational social platforms, a new generation of sophisticated AI tools are being developed by companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, steeped in this same culture, promising to streamline everything from citizen engagement to [administrative processes](https://www.anthropic.com/news/mou-uk-government). These black box large language models (LLMs) and AI systems, too, carry the inherent biases of the Bay Area, even if innocently.

## The Real Damage

Our very own [YIMBY movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIMBY) is an example of this tech-driven politics. San Francisco's housing crisis jump started a movement pushed for a neoliberal deregulation of the housing market and initially funded by tech monies. Now that ideology has spread to places with completely different housing markets, different histories, and different communities. Never mind that it started in a place where few have backyards and where most of the organizing has been disproportionately focused on changing dense, transit-rich, working-class neighborhoods.

https://www.rte.ie/news/uk/2021/0225/1199455-yimby-movement/

But there's a dark side to our current YIMBYfied housing model: it doesn't just create housing. It also happens to destroy the political infrastructure that working-class politics depends on.

Traditional electoral organizing happens when people get to talk to one another. You knock doors in neighborhoods where renters live and connect with people who face similar struggles.

But inclusionary housing scatters working-class families as minorities throughout wealthy neighborhoods. You can't do door-to-door organizing when voters are isolated in high-rise buildings with paid security or managed by restrictive "apolitical" nonprofits. The result is diminished political influence unless it aligns with the priorities of their wealthier neighbors.

So campaigns get forced onto digital platforms. The same platforms owned by the same tech executives who pushed the housing policies that destroyed neighborhood organizing in the first place and who have much deeper pockets and understand how to leverage the algorithms in their favor.

## The Money Trail

This isn't purely accidental though. The same venture capital money funding political platforms also funds the political groups reshaping San Francisco elections. Chris Larsen, the cryptobro who co-founded Ripple, gave millions to support police surveillance technology and political candidates. Y Combinator's CEO is famously involved in organizing San Francisco's political agenda. We have recent arrivals shaping the AI tools that local and state governments will use for the foreseeable future.

While San Francisco's broader political landscape is famously diverse and contentious, the concentrated wealth and shared incentives propagated by investors, venture capital and associated tech incubators foster a notable homogeneity within the very community building the digital platforms that increasingly govern global public life. They're not just building tools. They're building a political system where their tools become the arbiters.

## Fighting Back

The solution isn't to reform these platforms. You can't fix tools that are working exactly as intended. The solution is to build different infrastructure and shift away from these corporate solutions. Organizing methods that don't depend on corporate algorithmic digital amplification. Revive out IRL third spaces like places of worship and union halls and social gathering spaces.

It means building political organizations that practice the democracy we want, instead of trying to optimize democracy. It means accepting that the platforms aren't neutral, the tools aren't helping, and the people building them and making billions off them aren't on our side.

## What Comes Next

Like in 1960, this is a political inflection point. While definitively isolating this specific San Francisco-born influence from the broader tapestry of global political trends and local particularities would be an incredibly complex, perhaps impossible, empirical task, its demonstrable presence as a significant factor in shaping the digital infrastructure of democracy is reason enough for urgent, critical attention. Most people using the tools created have no idea they're adopting at least some of our political assumptions. Someone in the Midwest organizing an electoral campaign thinks they're using neutral technology to improve democracy. They don't know they're influenced by one city's very specific, dysfunctional approach to political conflict.

Democracy becomes something you do through tools built by people mostly shaped by San Francisco's rough and tumble politics, or increasingly, through the AI systems they design. Representation gets mediated by algorithms and black box LLMs designed by people who've never organized a community meeting and reject the idea that community disagreements and tension are normal. Political power flows to whoever understands how to game systems built by engineers who think legitimate tension is a bug to be fixed, funded by the shareholders made wealthy by these systems and subsidized by the politicians that got elected because of them. That's the genius and the horror of it. It feels like technological progress. It looks like better government – more efficient, more streamlined. But it’s actually political conquest through infrastructure, a subtle re-engineering of the democratic process from within. It doesn't seek to resolve tension or conflict, which festers until it explodes.

And unless people start recognizing what's happening, San Francisco's approach to politics becomes everyone's approach to politics. A world where technical optimization replaces actual politics and compromise. Where conflict gets sidelined instead of addressed. Where politics becomes something you consume instead of something you do.

I've watched it happen here. Now I'm watching it spread everywhere else.

The question is whether anyone will choose to build something different before it's too late.
